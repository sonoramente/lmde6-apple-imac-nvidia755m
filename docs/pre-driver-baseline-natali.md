# Pre-Driver Baseline — Natali iMac

This document captures the system state **before installation of the proprietary NVIDIA driver**.

## Purpose
Establish a clean baseline to verify:
- hardware detection
- kernel version
- graphics driver state
- DKMS state

## Evidence
See logs:
- logs/pre-driver-kernel-release.txt
- logs/pre-driver-uname.txt
- logs/pre-driver-lsb_release.txt
- logs/pre-driver-gpu-pci.txt
- logs/pre-driver-gpu-modules.txt
- logs/pre-driver-xorg-driver.txt
- logs/pre-driver-dkms-status.txt
- logs/pre-driver-nvidia-packages.txt
- logs/pre-driver-boot-mode.txt

No proprietary NVIDIA components were installed at the time of capture.
